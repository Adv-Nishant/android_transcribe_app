# Offline Voice Input (Android)

An offline, privacy-focused speech-to-text tool for Android, built with Rust. Tap the microphone on the keyboard you already use — your speech is transcribed entirely on-device and typed into any app. Also includes live subtitles and an optional dedicated voice keyboard.

## Features

- **Voice input in any app:** Tap the microphone on the keyboard you already use (SwiftKey, etc.) or a website's voice search, and your speech is transcribed straight into the text field. The app registers as your device's speech-to-text provider.
- **100% offline & private:** The Parakeet TDT model runs entirely on-device — no audio ever leaves your phone, and no network is required.
- **Live Subtitles:** Real-time captions for any audio/video playing on your device.
- **Optional voice keyboard:** A built-in keyboard you can switch to for voice input wherever you prefer it.
- **Supported Languages:** Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Russian, Ukrainian.
- **Custom models:** Import any [transcribe.cpp](https://github.com/handy-computer/transcribe.cpp) GGUF model (Whisper, Nemotron streaming, Canary, more Parakeet variants, …) from a downloaded file — the app stays fully offline; downloads happen in your browser.
- **Efficient native backend:** All models run through [transcribe.cpp](https://github.com/handy-computer/transcribe.cpp) (ggml), wrapped in a safe Rust core.

## Usage

### Voice input in any app (recommended)

1. Open **Offline Voice Input** once and grant the microphone permission. The home screen shows a **Voice input** status — green when you're ready to go.
2. In any app, tap the **microphone** on your keyboard (e.g. Microsoft SwiftKey) or the voice-search mic on a website. A compact panel slides up over the app you're in, you speak, and your words are inserted as text. Tap to stop — or enable *Auto-stop after silence* in the app's settings to have it stop by itself.

The app plugs into Android's speech-to-text in **three** ways, so it works with a wide range of keyboards and apps:

| Path | Who uses it | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| **Voice-input popup** (`RECOGNIZE_SPEECH`) | SwiftKey, website voice search, many apps | The compact bottom panel opens over the current app |
| **System speech service** (`RecognitionService`) | Keyboards/apps using Android's `SpeechRecognizer` | Recognition runs invisibly in the background with automatic endpointing |
| **Voice keyboard (IME)** | Any keyboard, via the keyboard switcher — also HeliBoard/AnySoftKeyboard-style "switch to voice IME" mic keys | The dedicated voice keyboard opens |

Tap **Try voice input** on the home screen to test the whole flow in one tap.

**Keyboard notes** (mic-key behavior verified against each keyboard's source and tested in the emulator):

- **Microsoft SwiftKey** (not open source) opens the compact voice panel directly, like website voice search does. If SwiftKey's own voice typing opens instead, go to SwiftKey Settings → *Rich input* → turn off **Multi-modal voice typing**.
- **AnySoftKeyboard** is the open-source way to get the panel: its mic key fires the standard speech intent as long as no *voice keyboard* is enabled on the system. (If one is enabled — ours or Google's — it switches to that instead.)
- **HeliBoard, FlorisBoard, OpenBoard, Fossify Keyboard, Unexpected Keyboard:** their mic key never opens the panel — it switches to the system *voice input keyboard*. Enable the **Offline Voice Input** keyboard (see below) and it opens automatically; its keyboard-switch key takes you back. **FUTO Keyboard** ships its own built-in voice input.
- **Gboard:** only uses Google's own voice typing, so it can't hand speech to this app at all.
- If Android shows a chooser, pick **Offline Voice Input** and tap **Always**. If another app always opens, clear its default in *Settings → Apps*.

### Dedicated voice keyboard (optional)

Prefer voice input as its own keyboard? Enable the **Offline Voice Input** keyboard via *Open Keyboard Settings* on the home screen, switch to it from your keyboard switcher, then tap **Tap to Record**. By default the recording keeps running even if you switch apps or the keyboard closes (turn off *Record in background* in settings if you don't want that) — the text is inserted when you come back.

### Live subtitles

Tap **Start Live Subtitles** and choose *Share entire screen* to get real-time, on-device captions for any audio or video playing on your device.

**Advanced: skip the screen-capture dialog.** Android shows a "Start recording or casting?" consent dialog every time subtitles start. You can pre-approve it once via adb — after that, subtitles start instantly and the setting survives reboots (USB debugging can be turned off again afterwards):

```bash
adb shell appops set --user 0 dev.notune.transcribe PROJECT_MEDIA allow
```

To undo it:

```bash
adb shell appops set --user 0 dev.notune.transcribe PROJECT_MEDIA default
```

This relies on the undocumented `PROJECT_MEDIA` app-op; on some OEM builds it may not work or may get reset by the system — the normal dialog remains the fallback. The same instructions are shown in-app under *Skip the permission dialog (advanced)*.

### Custom speech models

The built-in Parakeet model works out of the box. (The F-Droid build has no built-in model, since F-Droid builds everything from source: on first start, the app shows how to download the same model in your browser and import it. The F-Droid build is reproducible and carries the same signature as the GitHub releases, which also include it as `…_fdroid.apk`, so you can switch between the GitHub/Obtainium and F-Droid versions without reinstalling.) Under **Manage speech models** you can additionally import any [transcribe.cpp](https://github.com/handy-computer/transcribe.cpp) GGUF model: download a `.gguf` file in your browser (the in-app *Where to get models* dialog lists direct links, e.g. a tiny 135 MB English-only Parakeet, the multilingual Nemotron 3.5 streaming model with punctuation, or Whisper large-v3-turbo), then import it via the system file picker and select it. The app itself needs no internet permission — model files are simply copied into the app's private storage. An optional language hint (e.g. `en-US`, or `auto`) can be set for imported models.

## Prerequisites

| Dependency | Installation |
|---|---|
| **JDK 17** | Android Studio (bundled) or `sudo pacman -S jdk17-openjdk` |
| **Android SDK** | Via Android Studio or `sdkmanager` |
| **Android NDK** | `sdkmanager "ndk;28.0.13004108"` |
| **Rust** | [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) + `rustup target add aarch64-linux-android` |
| **cargo-ndk** | `cargo install cargo-ndk` |

### Local Configuration

Create a `local.properties` file in the project root (this file is gitignored):

```properties
sdk.dir=/path/to/your/Android/Sdk
```

Gradle uses `JAVA_HOME`. If your default Java is not JDK 17 (Gradle 8.9 can't run on JDK 22+), point Gradle at one in your user-level `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` instead of the project file:

```properties
org.gradle.java.home=/path/to/jdk17
# Examples:
#   /opt/android-studio/jbr          (Android Studio bundled JBR, if it is JDK 17/21)
#   /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk     (System JDK 17)
```

## Building

The app has two build flavors: `standard` (GitHub releases, Google Play) bundles the Parakeet model, `fdroid` is the same app without it.

### Debug APK
```bash
./gradlew assembleStandardDebug
# Output: app/build/outputs/apk/standard/debug/app-standard-debug.apk
```

### Release APK
```bash
./gradlew assembleStandardRelease
# Output: app/build/outputs/apk/standard/release/app-standard-release.apk
```

### Release AAB (Google Play)
```bash
./gradlew bundleStandardRelease
# Output: app/build/outputs/bundle/standardRelease/app-standard-release.aab
```

### F-Droid flavor (no bundled model)
```bash
./gradlew assembleFdroidRelease
# Output: app/build/outputs/apk/fdroid/release/app-fdroid-release.apk
```

### Signing

For release builds, place a `release.keystore` in the project root and set these environment variables:

```bash
export KEY_ALIAS=release
export KEY_PASS=yourpassword
export STORE_PASS=yourpassword
```

### Model Assets

The built-in Parakeet TDT GGUF model (~485 MB) is automatically downloaded from HuggingFace during the first `standard` build via a Gradle task. The checksum is verified with SHA-256. No manual download is needed. `fdroid` builds never download it.
